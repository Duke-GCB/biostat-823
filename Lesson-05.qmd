## OLTP vs OLAP

| OLTP <br/><span style="font-size:smaller">(Online Transaction Processing)</span>   | OLAP <br/><span style="font-size:smaller">(Online Analytical Processing)</span> |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Real-time data transactions            | Data analysis (BI) |
| Fast response times, protected data integrity | Dataset generation for question answering |
| frequent INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE        | SELECT, frequently aggregated |
| Highly normalized design               | Denormalized design |
| Constantly updated                     | Read-only, periodically refreshed |

## Data Warehousing

* Data Warehouses support OLAP use-cases and applications.
* Typically built by ETL or ELT process(es)
* Often from multiple source databases 
* Denormalized database schema design based on fact and dimension tables

## Extract--Transform--Load (ETL)

* Often uses staging tables and/or databases
* Transformation in external software or in SQL
* Note that tables can be created directly from query:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE tablename AS SELECT ...
  ```

## Datamarts vs Data Warehouse {.smaller}

* Datamart is a type of Data Warehouse
  - Datamarts are typically more narrow in data scope
  - Typically focused on one subject area
  - Easier and less time-consuming to build
  - Less memory and storage-intensive than a full Data Warehouse

## Star Schema {.smaller}

* Uses one (central) Fact table and multiple Dimension tables
* Fact table houses quantitative metrics or measurements
  - Typically aggregated, based on chosen _granularity_ (of dimension(s))
  - Foreign key to each dimension
    ![](images/SQL/star-schema-example2.png){width="40%" style="float: right"}
* Dimension tables house the dimensions along which to aggregate or slice facts
  - Time, location, people, etc
  - Typically denormalized
  - Each dimension table has 1:n relationship to the fact table
* Fact table normally has orders of magnitude more rows than dimension tables
* In essence, this represents a data cube
  - Fact table is the cells; dimension tables are the dimensions ("axes") of the cube

## Clinical data warehouse example

## Snowflake Schema

* A _Snowflake Schema_ is a Star Schema with more denormalized dimension tables

![From Wikipedia, [Example of a Snowflake Schema by SqlPac](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Snowflake-schema-example.png)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Snowflake-schema-example.png){width="60%"}

## Reverse Star Schema

* Deployed for descriptive or observational facts
  - Quantitative metrics often are not meaningful
  - Typically multiple related facts ("dimension" table rows) for the central fact
    ![Figure 1 of [Zhang _et al_ (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1093/database/bar038)](images/SQL/biomart-reverse-star.jpeg "Figure 1 of Zhang et al (2011), BioMart: a data federation framework for large collaborative projects. doi:10.1093/database/bar038"){width="40%" style="float: right"}
  - Queries often involve attributes of the central fact
* Fact table has 1:n ("reversed") relationship to each "dimension"
  - Hence, fact table is usually smaller than any of the dimension tables

## Data Warehouses in Bioinformatics

* Many biomedical and biological data warehouse systems follow the Reverse Star Schema model
